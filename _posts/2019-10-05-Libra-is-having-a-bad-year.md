Paypal has pulled out of a key meeting of Libra leading to uncertainity in their partnership. The Libra members had to meet 
in this meeting to discuss about the new CryptoCurrency-Libra.

Earlier this year, Libra was criticized by the congress. As usual, many also don't seem to get excited about Libra as it could
easily become a platform for money laundering. Besides Facebook's recent track record isn't as great.

Whether or not you will use Libra but Facebook doesn't seems to be having a good year.
