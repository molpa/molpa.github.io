In an attempt to minimize the damage done by Microsoft's xcloud and Google's stadia to the Playstation brand, sony has 
decided to cut down PS Now monthly subscription service by almost 50%. 

The new prices are:
~~$19.99~~ >> $9.99
~~$44.99~~ >> $24.99
~~$99.99~~ >> $59.99

Sony has also added God of War(2018), GTA 5, Uncharted 4 and Infamous Second Son to the games list. Whether or not this is a 
good move but it's sure a good time to get a PS Now subsription.
