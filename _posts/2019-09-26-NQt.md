Most of the apps I develop are windows and linux based and use Qt C++, both for the ui and the logic.
But no matter how much I try to like C++, I always get reasons for not liking it.
I miss the good ol' days of doing everything in C.

So I checked out Gtk and my god, I just realised why many hate it and are moving to Qt.
Minimal backwards compatibility and tied to GNOME are the proper descriptions of Gtk.
I also tried many so called cross platform toolkits and not even one came close to Qt. 

A void has developed in the C enviroment for a proper cross platform toolkit. Naturally, many
have tried to fill this void by forcing the C lang behave like C++ and this results in the catastrophic 
failure. 

So I decided to start project NQt, a proper Qt alternative for C. 
* Total backwards compatibility
* Total cross platformity
* Not making C behave like C++
* Fast and light
* Maximum security
* No forced design principles
* Maximum customisibility
* Maximum language bindings

While one may argue that such ambitious projects are impossible and this is nothing but just vaporware,
we firmly believe that with a clear goal and a proper roadmap, we can achieve this. No doubt this 
will take a long time, but we aren't in hurry. Hope, we succeed.
