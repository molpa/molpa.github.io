As an Odia language enthusiast, I spend considerable amount of time translating softwares to odia language. 
Every now often, I come across technology related words which to be fair require a decent amount of work to
find their substitudes in odia. And once you find the perfect substitude for that word, you wouldn't want your 
hardwork to go into void. 

So, I started the DEO project that would serve as a solution for this. The DEO project stores the perfect 
collection of substitude odia words of english, handpicked by me. The collection is small now but as more
and more words will come across me, I would surely add them to DEO project.

Of course, the DEO project is open-source. You can view the source here: [](https://github.com/proneon267/deo) . Feel 
free to contribute to this project. 

Well a small but significant step to develop the finest odia language standard in the world. Wish us luck 
for DEO project's future.
