In the court of appeal, Google has been charged $3.2 billion pounds. This is 
regarding the unethical data harvesting done by Google. The legal action is
taken by the group GoogleYouOweUs whose main aim is hold Google accountable.

Apparently, Google was so desperate that it bypassed Iphone privacy settings 
to get the sweet sweet private data. This illegal data harvesting mostly 
affects users in the UK.

If the lawsuits will be won then the 4.4 billion users will get compensation, 
with each user getting 750 pounds.
