This year on surface event, microsoft has announced a new foldable phone, named Surface duo. But contrary to what comes to your
mind when you hear "foldable", it is not a flexible foldable display phone. It's a simple setup with two non-flexible displays
which to all seems like a miniature Surface Neo. But unlike the Neo, the duo doesn't run windows X, rather custom android. Microsoft 
has added some features to the android os to make the dual screen continuum work seamlessly.

But the most surprising is that by using simple 2 separate display system, Microsoft has altogether bypassed the problems that 
flexible non-foldable display bring with them. The device comes with the following specs:
* 2 5.6-inch displays attached with 
* Qualcom Snapdragon 855 processor
* Fingerprint Reader
* USB-C port
* 360Â° hinge 

Despite whether or not you want to call it a phone, this design is quite similar to
the design of the famous Nintendo 3DS.
